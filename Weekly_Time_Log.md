method 

### Thursday, Sept 12th 3 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise determineInverseCaptcha logic.  Added Logger statements to verify input file being processed correctly.  Used a 
smaller part of the input file initially to verify the logic was working correctly.  Edited a copy of 
the input file to find the expected value for the Junit test.  Ran Junit tests and test passed.

### Saturday, Sept 14th 9 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise to add additional Junit tests.  Rewrote determineInverseCaptcha logic after rereading how the 
files should be processed.  Had trouble figuring out how to test the FileNotFoundException, but once I added to throw 
the exception and not catch them, then it returned the exception to the test correctly.
Started week 3 custom tag library demo and activity.

### Sunday, Sept 15th 8 hours
Didn't have week 3 activity for custom tag library working.  Completed this weeks readings, which helped.  Was able to

a model.
