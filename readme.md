### Problem Statement 

As part owner of a restaurant where we have a point of service (POS) system.  The POS system includes a Scheduler to 
be able to create a weekly work schedule for employees that are in the POS system.  It is not easy to use and doesnâ€™t 
allow you to schedule employees for a time period that is not an actual time (for example, 2 PM to Close).  

   
Currently, employees will submit a paper monthly calendar of days/times they need off for the upcoming month..  They can 
also request off for dates beyond the upcoming month.  For example, dates they need off for a vacation several months 
from now.  Those dates are typically written on a different calendar.  

Producing the weekly work schedule is being done manually and the manager writing up the schedule has to look through 
all the paper time off requests and the wall calendar when creating a schedule.  A blank template is printed off with 
the days of the week and the names of the current 
employees on it and split into 4 areas:
1.	Shift Manager
2.	Front of House (FOH), which is for people working the registers, drive-thru and to keep the dining area clean
3.	Back of House (BOH), which is the various kitchen staff
4.  Bussers

I want to create a scheduling system that will allow users to submit time off requests and that managers can create a 
weekly work schedule that includes any current employees.  The time off request information needs to be available when 
creating the schedule for the work week to try an accommodate any days/times that the employees need off.

The powerpoint demo of the appication was too large of a file for github, so had to remove it
